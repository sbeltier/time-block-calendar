# time-block-calendar

Description: this calendar enables the user to add and save their daily work tasks.

Usage: Users can type their daily task in the input box. The blue save button MUST be clicked in order for the task to be saved. Upon returning to the webpage, previous tasks written will remain. However, if a task is overwritten with a new one, the previous one will no longer be stored. Throughout the work day, the calendar conveniently changes colors based on the current time, allowsing the user to quickly identify what tasks should have already been completed (gray), which one should be currently worked on (red), and which tasks are coming up in the future (green). 

Known Issues: During the hours of 10p - 3am, the styling is slightly mismatched. For that reason, it is advised to update your tasks and work during operating hours, not late at night!
